Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nischay. 

I specialise in designing and delivering Data and AI initiatives that help organisations become insight-led and AI-enabled. With over 8 years of experience at the intersection of data, AI, and cloud architecture, I have enabled organisations with better data by designing and delivering modern, scalable Data and AI platforms and production-grade AI / ML solutions.

My journey spans Solution Architecture, Data Engineering, Data Science, and AI Engineering, giving me a unique ability to connect business strategy with real-world technical implementationâ€”turning complex problems into automated, intelligent systems.

Iâ€™ve led initiatives across utilities, higher education, logistics, state government, healthcare, and high-performance sports, delivering outcomes that improve decision-making, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation.
